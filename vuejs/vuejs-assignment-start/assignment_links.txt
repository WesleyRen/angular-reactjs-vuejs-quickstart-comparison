Problem  Code  on  JSFiddle:  https://jsfiddle.net/smax/tkn7pdev/
Hint:
To  remove  a  hobby,  you  can  find  the  position  of  an  element  with  the  indexOf method  which  
you  can  use  on  any  JavaScript  array.  You  may  then  use  the  splice() method  on  an  array,  to  
splice  1  element,  starting  at  position  X  like  this  =>  splice(X,1)
